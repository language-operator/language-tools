# Optimize

Suggest an improvement that could improve the quality of the codebase or developer experience.  Things like opportunities to reduce lines of code, DRYing up code, or eliminating dead code paths.

An important thing to consider is that this code has been written by different agents with different contexts, who may not have been aware of overall patterns.  These kinds of optimizations are high priority.

This repository is a registry of tools for the Language Operator and each tool is built using the Language Operator gem (language-operator/language-operator-gem). Perhaps consider ways that common patterns in tool implementations could be promoted to features in the SDK as well.

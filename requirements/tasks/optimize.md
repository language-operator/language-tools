# Optimize

Suggest an improvement that could improve the quality of the codebase or developer experience.  Things like opportunities to reduce lines of code, DRYing up code, or eliminating dead code paths.

An important thing to consider is that this code has been written by different agents with different contexts, who may not have been aware of overall patterns.  These kinds of optimizations are high priority.

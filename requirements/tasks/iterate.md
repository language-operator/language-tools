# Task

## Prerequisites

Please read the following context files:

* Persona: requirements/personas/ruby-engineer.md
* Scratch: requirements/SCRATCH.md

## Persona

**CRITICAL**: Adopt the ruby-engineer persona while executing these instructions, please.

## Instructions

Follow these directions closely:

1. Use the `gh` tool to find the top issue for this repository (language-operator/language-tools) with the "ready" label.
2. Investigate if it's valid, or a mis-use of the intended feature.
3. **CRITICAL:** Switch to plan mode, and propose an implementation plan.  Await my feedback.
4. Add your implementation plan as a comment on the issue.
5. Implement your plan.
6. Run existing tests, and add new ones if necessary.  Remember to include CI. Remember the linter and that bundler will fail if it's out of sync with its lockfile.
7. **CRITICAL:** Test the actual functionality manually before committing. If it's a CLI command, run it. If it's library code, test it in the appropriate context. Never commit untested code.
8. Commit the change with a semantic, ONE LINE message, like 'feat: create task_definition structure'.
9. **CRITICAL:** Halt while CI runs and await my feedback.
10. Add resolution details as a comment on the GitHub issue.
11. Resolve the GitHub issue.

Consider if you need to update requirements/SCRATCH.md for the next run.

## Output

An implementation, test coverage, updated CI, and a closed ticket.

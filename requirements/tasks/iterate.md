# Iterate

Background: this is a early-phase project that works exclusively in main, and each task is a patch release.

Follow these directions closely:

1. Use the ForgeJo tool to find the top issue for this repository (language-operator/language-tools).
2. Investigate if it's valid, or a mis-use of the intended feature.
3. Plan your course of action and propose it before making changes.
4. Add your implementation plan as a comment on the issue.
5. Implement the changes.
6. Run existing tests, and add new ones if necessary.
7. **CRITICAL: Test the actual functionality manually before committing.** If it's a CLI command, run it. If it's library code, test it in the appropriate context. Never commit untested code.
8. Commit the change and push to origin.
9. Wait for the user to confirm CI passes, and until all errors are resolved.
12. Comment on your solution in the ForgeJo issue.
13. Resolve the issue.
